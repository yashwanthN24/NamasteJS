// A Block is defined by {} curly braces

// A Block is also called a Compound Statement

// A Block is used to combine multiple JS statements into one group

// Just like this

{
    // compound statement
    var a = 12;
    console.log(a);
}


if (true) {
    var a = 11; 
    console.log(a);
}

{
    var a1 = 10; 
    let b = 13; 
    const c = 89;
    
}

console.log(a1);
console.log(c);


// let and const are block scoped and accessible only within that block in which
// they are defined

// var has lexical scope
