<!-- Benefits of event delegation:
1) improves memory space
2) mitigates risk of performance bottle neck
3) Dom manipulation
4) when elements get added dynamically, the process of adding events is slow
Limitations:
1) All the events are not bubbled up, some events like blur, focus are not bubbled up
2) if e.stopPropogation is used in child, then events are not bubbled up -->
